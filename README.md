Final File compression Project
Software Engineering 2

This Project implements LZW, Huffman and Tars algorithms
to compress files. The algorithms and codes can accept
single file command line inputs or globs. This
project also uncompresses files created by any of the
three compression methods.

All of the CLI instructions, Algorithm Theories, and
tradeoffs are included at the top of each compression file.
The project can be run using maven or the command line.
